            This certificate of completion is hereby awarded to for the
            successful completion of the loss stated above. This project was
            completed by PEAKTEK ROOFING & RESTORATION, a contractor in the
            state of Tennessee, in accordance with all relevant building codes.
            We certify that all work on this project was completed in compliance
            with Tennessee code. Our team of qualified professionals ensured
            that all work was done to the highest standards and met all relevant
            codes and regulations.

          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 text-base text-justify">
            We request that the depreciation on this loss claim be released to
            PeakTek Roofing & Restoration as the work assigned by the customer
            to PeakTek has been completed and meets all requirements set forth
            by the insurance scope. We have thoroughly inspected the completed
            work and ensured that it meets all of the standards.

          <h2 className="font-semibold mb-2">Overhead and Profit: </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 text-base text-justify">
            We also request that overhead and profit be included in the final
            claim settlement. This is in compliance with Tennessee law, which
            requires that overhead and profit be included in the final project
            cost. Our team of experts worked to ensure that all aspects of the
            project were completed to the highest standards, and we believe that
            our work deserves to be compensated fairly.
